# RelicGenerator
The Relic Generator generates magical treasures for use with the worlds most popular role playing game. "Relics" are
not officially part of any existing version of the game. The idea of a Relic is borrowed from the Numenera RPG by 
Monte Cook. Numenera proposes technological/magical treasures, each with a single use powers. These are called Cyphers 
in Numenera. The idea of porting these into D&D comes from [Slyflourish](http://slyflourish.com/relics.html). I ported 
the Github project [here](https://github.com/mshea/DnD-5e-Relics) to Swift, and built an interface in Xcode. 

You can download the app [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/relic-generator/id1051178140?mt=8).

#Features
Besides generating a random Relic with a random description, features, and spell effect, the Relic Generator can also 
send the Relic via Email or as text message.
